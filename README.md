# Thompson-Sampling
This is a simple implementation of the Thompson Sampling algorithm, used for learning.   
This project simulates the behavior of targeting specific user groups with advertising links. By selecting appropriate types of ads, the goal is to maximize the number of clicks on the ad links.   
The click rates follow a Bernoulli distribution.  
```
P(click=1) = Pi
P(click=0) = 1-Pi
```

where 0 <= Pi <= 1 (1 <= i <= N) are constants and independent of each other.
